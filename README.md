This code does NOT belong to me. I am using this code as a base for my own games website.

# Announcements:
This area is where I will announce stuff, duh.

I'm taking a break from trying to make the website work. The original owner of ExpGames and ExpiredGamez has taken down ExpiredGamez in response to me and my friends using the webpage.
Expgames, I would like to remind you that ExpiredGamez was originally reopened for public use by you. We are the public.

Expgames has challenged me and everyone who wishes to find their last website. As a reward, they will give us their "Ultimate games website."

Expgames, if you are reading this, challenge accecpted. I have been acting on the matter for a few days now and all I have to say is....

Trust no one.
