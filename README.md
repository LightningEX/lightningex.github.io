# Announcements:
This area is where I will announce stuff, duh.

I ALMOST got Subway Surfers up! There is one file that is 27MB, so its too big to upload through the Github website, which Im using. I'll see if I can download the desktop version but I might not be able to since Im doing all this from my school compute. If anyone was wondering, yes Im still in class and I juts finished my last final for today!
